**1. Simulated vs. Situated or Embodied**  
 - Simulated: This approach involves creating AI systems that operate in simulated environments, often virtual worlds or computer simulations. These systems learn and make decisions based on data generated within these environments.  
 - Example of Simulated: AI for playing chess.  
 - Situated: The agent that acts directly on the actual environment.  
 - Embodied: The agent has physical body in real world.  
 - Example of Situated and Embodied: AI player for playing football.  

**2. Static vs. Dynamic**  
 - Static: the environment does not change while agent is thinking and processing.  
 - Example for Static: AI for playing chess.  
 - Dynamic: the environment may change while agent is thinking and processing.  
 - Example for Dynamic: AI player for playing football.  

**3. Discrete vs. Continuous**  
 - Discrete: a finite or countable number of actions.  
 - Example of Discrete: AI for playing chess.  
 - Continuous: Actions can vary continously.  
 - Example of Continuous: AI player for playing football.  

**4. Fully Observable vs. Partially Observable**
 - Fully Observable: The agent can have all the information about the environment.  
 - Example of Fully Observable: AI for playing chess.  
 - Partially Observable: The agent just only have partial information about the environment.  
 - Example of Partially Observable: AI for playing card game.  

**5. Deterministic vs. Stochastic**
 - Deterministic: The outcomes are entirely predictable given the initial conditions and the rules or laws governing the system.  
 - Example of Deterministic: AI for playing chess.  
 - Stochastic: Randomness or uncertainty plays a significant role in determining outcomes.  
 - Example of Stochastic: AI player for playing football.  

**6. Episodic vs. Sequential**
 - Episodic: Designed to reason and make decisions based on specific episodes or experiences. These systems typically store and retrieve individual episodes of experience, which may include sensory inputs, actions taken, and outcomes observed.  
 - Example of Episodic: AI agent learns from interactions with its environment by storing episodes of experience in memory. Each episode consists of a sequence of states, actions, rewards, and next states, and the agent learns to optimize its behavior based on the outcomes of these episodes.  
 - Sequential: Focus on processing and understanding sequences of data or events. These systems analyze input data over time and identify patterns or relationships within sequential data streams.  
 - Example of Sequential: Following a recipe to bake a cake involves a sequential process where you perform a series of steps in a specific order (e.g., mixing ingredients, pouring the batter into a pan, baking in the oven) to produce the final product.  

**7. Known vs. Unknown**
 - Known: Refers to data, facts, or variables that are provided or available to the AI system. This could include training data, rules, patterns, or any other information that the system has been explicitly provided with or has learned from.  
 - Example of Known: AI for playing chess.  
 - Unknown: Refers to data or variables that are not provided or available to the AI system initially. This could include new or unseen data that the system has not encountered before, or variables whose values are uncertain or not yet determined.  
 - Example of Unknown: Video Games like Infinite Mario.  

**8. Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent**
 - Single-Agent: In single-agent systems, there is only one autonomous entity or agent that interacts with its environment to achieve specific goals or tasks. Single-agent systems are often used in scenarios where there is a single decision-maker or actor, such as in optimization problems, robotics, and game playing.  
 - Example of Single-Agent: AI for playing chess.  
 - Multi-Agent: In multi-agent systems, there are multiple autonomous entities or agents that interact with each other and possibly with their environment to achieve individual and/or collective goals. Multi-agent systems are used in scenarios where there are multiple decision-makers or entities whose actions may affect each other, such as in social simulations, negotiation, traffic control, and distributed problem-solving.  
 - Example of Multi-Agent: AI players for playing football.  

**9. Situated vs. Embodied**
 - Situated but not Embodied: High frequency stock trading system:
   - It deals with thousands of buy/sell bids per second and its responses vary as its database changes but it interacts with the world only through sending and receivingmessages.  
 - Embodied but not Situated: an industrial spray painting robot:
   - Does not perceive any aspects of the shape of an object presented to it for painting; simply goes through a pre-programmed series of actions but it has physical extent and its servo routines must correct for its interactions with gravity and noise present in the system.
